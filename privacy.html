                <p>Welcome to Node Orbis ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we might collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website <a href="https://nodeorbis.vercel.app">https://nodeorbis.vercel.app</a> (the "Site") and engage with our conceptual products and services. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.</p>

                <p>Given the conceptual nature of Node Orbis and its projects, actual data collection is minimal and primarily related to standard website interaction and voluntary submissions (e.g., contact forms, newsletter signups). This policy reflects that conceptual framework.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">1. Information We Might Conceptually Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect on the Site includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Personal Data:</strong> Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, and telephone number, that you voluntarily give to us when you fill out a contact form, subscribe to a newsletter, or otherwise interact with the Site. You are under no obligation to provide us with personal information of any kind; however, your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the Site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Derivative Data:</strong> Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site, such as your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Site. This is standard for most web servers and is typically anonymized or aggregated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data From Social Networks:</strong> If you connect with us via social media, we may collect user information from social networking sites, such as your name, your social network username, location, gender, birth date, email address, profile picture, and public data for contacts, if you allow this through your social media privacy settings.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">2. How We Might Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Site to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respond to your inquiries and support requests.</li>
                    <li>Send you newsletters or other information about Node Orbis, if you have opted in.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Site.</li>
                    <li>Prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft, and protect against criminal activity (conceptually).</li>
                    <li>Request feedback and contact you about your use of the Site or our conceptual products.</li>
                    <li>Compile anonymous statistical data and analysis for use internally or with third parties (e.g., for conceptual market research).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties except as described below or with your consent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance (e.g., a newsletter service provider). These providers would only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the hypothetical event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">4. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account (if applicable) or update your personal information by contacting us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of receiving newsletter or marketing emails from us by following the unsubscribe link in those emails or by contacting us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features of our Site. (<em>Note: As Node Orbis is currently a static site, cookie usage is likely minimal, e.g., from analytics if implemented.</em>)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">6. Third-Party Links/Services</h2>
                <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Site, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Site and conceptual services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if stipulated by local laws). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection-title-styled">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
